# Daily Task Report - December 23, 2024

Hello Sir,

I hope you are doing well. Here is today's task report:

Today, I worked on implementing user management and permission system for the billing software application.

I successfully created functionality that allows administrators to add new users to the website and assign specific module permissions to control which modules each user can access.

I also implemented two new modules for Breakage/Expiry to Supplier - one for issued items and another for received items. These modules track breakage and expiry items sent to suppliers and items received back from them.

With Regards,
[Your Name]
